    <p>
      We are seeking highly capable and self-motivated PhD candidates to be
      enrolled in the Priority Research Centre for Geotechnical Science and
      Engineering (PRCGSE) at <a style="text-decoration: none; " target="_blank" href="https://www.newcastle.edu.au/">the University of Newcastle (UoN), Australia,</a>
      ranked in the top 175 in the world, according to the 2024 QS World
      University Rankings. The candidates are expected to apply China
      Scholarship Council (CSC) in <strong> Mar. 2025</strong> and enrol in
      <strong> Sep. 2025</strong>
      <h3>Research topic: Numerical modelling of large scale problems in geotechnical engineering</h3>
    </p>
     <p>
       In 2012,Prof Huang and his colleagues developed a novel contact dynamics approach based on variational 
       principle. This approach uses convex optimisation to solve governing equations and  is very robust. It uses 
       implicit time integration and is also efficient. Prof. JingJing Meng further advanced the approach for modelling rock
       failure problems and coupled it with FEM to handle interactions between continuous and discontinuous 
       materials. The Ph.D. candidate will have the opportunity to work with both professors to develop it to consider factors of pore
       water, temperature and, particle breakage, nonlinear contact laws, etc., or to apply it in studying various geohazards under extreme climates.
       The candidate can also develop it towards digital twins of large infrastructures projects for their risk assessment or economical maintenance 
       aided by machine learning.
